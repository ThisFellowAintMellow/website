<h3>1.1: Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
<p>My website consists of a simple, easy design. The main philosophy of the design was to avoid dated techniques and eyesore practices. The main aesthetic is a mix of light and dark blues in order to create a light, coloured theme without having to use bright, obnoxious neon colours. The design avoids visible boxes when possible, as I felt that static, visible box borders would give the website an older, more amateur appearance. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The background is a colour gradient, shifting from a bright, pastel sky blue to a deep-sea midnight blue. The gradient gives a visual indicator of how far down the webpage a user is. The the textbook border starts out a different colour to the background, placing emphasis on the main content of the page. As the user scrolls down the page, however, the gradient in the text-box border slowly begins to merge with the background, completely obscuring the lower borders of the text box. The obscuring effect does not serve any real purpose, but I liked how it looked.
        <br>
        <br>
        Elements on the website have rounded borders. This was done to make the website feel more modern and less boxy. The effect makes the web blog look less boxy and more aesthetically pleasing without actually making the page more complex, which immensely compliments the design philosophy that the project was made with.
        <br>
        <br>
        each page contains the documentation on different parts of the website. page 1 contains outcome 1 of unit one, page 2 contains outcome 2, page 3 contains outcome 3 and this page, page 4, contains all of unit 2.</p>

    <h3>1.5: Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
    <p>In the UK, there are a multitude of laws and regulations that control what kind of content can and cannot be displayed on a public website.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, <a class=intextlink href=https://www.hallaminternet.com/internet-marketing-and-the-law-legal-issues-affecting-you-and-your-website/>the Companies Act 2006,</a> as well as being over 700-page legalese nightmare, places requirements on what information about your company must be visible on your website. Including your company name, company registered number, place of registration, registered office address, postal address, company email address, how to contact your business via non-electronic means, VAT number, and any professional associations your company holds, such as parent companies, partnered companies, and so forth.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is also the GDPR, which restricts what information you can collect from users, with or without their permission. It also requires that a user be made aware of the cookies being used to track them, and that any data entry forms be clear, easy-to-understand, and not be filled with confusing legalese.</p>

    <h3>1.6: Describing access issues that need taking into account</h3>
    <p>firstly, those who are colourblind. This is a problem because, say you have both some text and the background in a colour the user can’t see, the user won’t be able to read it at all. To rectify this, you may wish to allow the option for colourblind users to be able to switch to a colour format they can see clearly with.
            <br>
            <br>
            If your website uses videos with sound, you may want to add the options for captions for deaf users in order for them to be able to still receive the information in the video. You may also wish to allow the option for a screen reader in order to allow blind people to still be able to use your webpages

    <h3>1.7: Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h3>
    <P>When creating a website, you may have to use a multitude of filetypes in order to add required elements to your webpage. There are a multitude of filetypes that you might use, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.
            <br>
            <br>
            .html - your entire website is programmed in the html5 language. You might need to use these files for individual webpages.
            <br>
            <br>
            .css - if you want your website to look nice, or have any interactive elements, such as buttons that link to other webpages on your website, you may need to use some .css
            <br>
            <br>
            .js - javascript is used to add interactive elements to pages that do not require hyperlinking to another page. For example, if you wanted to add a calculator to another page, you will need to program it in javascript.
            <br>
            <br>
            .jpg - jpg/jpeg files are light, lossy images that have small filesizes, due to them being compressed with lossy compression. This causes “artifacting” on the images, making them look worse, but if you only need images to get across a basic message, these are better for helping website performance.
            <br>
            <br>
            .png - a popular format for lossless images. These images tend to have better quality than .jpg images, due to their compression method retaining all of their data, and simply re-formatting them into a smaller format. however, having to decompress and render the image every time someone accesses your webpages is very resource-consuming, and can greatly slow down website performance if overused. This format should only be used sparingly, when you need high-quality images.</P>
