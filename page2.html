<h3>2.1: Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.
</h3>
<p>In the creation of my website, I have made use of several different tools in order to design, structure and build my blog. For the process of designing my website, I used trello to layout the different features that I wanted to add to my website. From there, I was able to decide which elements were more important than others and keep track of what I had already done, what I still had to do, and what I could try if I had the time after the more important elements of the website had been implemented.
    <br>
    <br>
    For the process of actually building my website, I made use of VScode which has the means to create the .html and .css files needed to create the website already built-in. VScode is a very useful programming environment that allows for easy use of different kinds of software and web development. With several tools built-in that allow for auto-completion of code snippets and tooltips to keep track of what elements do what.
    <br>
    <br>
    The hardware that I created my project on, however, was less-than-great. The MacBook I have been working on was not very comfortable to work with. The slow hardware quickly overheated due to there being, at the least, two monitors working off the same processor, and several programs open at once on either screen.
    <br>
    <br>
    overall, I’m very happy with the tools I used for this project. They were simple, easy-to-use and, most importantly, hassle-free, which allowed me to spend more time creating my web blog and less time trying to learn and troubleshoot problems with the tools I was using.</p>

<h3>2.2: Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h3>
<p>As described in 2.1, the tools I made use of to create my website, being VScode and trello, were very useful, if not integral to the creation of my web project. VScode permitted easy creation of .html and .css files, which were needed in the creation of a website, as well as tools within the environment itself that helped with development, such as error-finders, syntax suggestions, code auto-complete and suggestions.
    <br>
    <br>
    Trello was also a very appropriate tool to use in the development of this website, being a very efficient method of creating a to-do list of the features and  elements that you wish to add to your website. It easily allowed for the process of adding elements of the website the needed done, assigning priority and keeping a list of what had already been added.

<h3>2.3: Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.</h3>
<p>The web-blog I have created is, overall, designed more for the basic function is was made to accomplish rather than any variety of style or grace. This “function over form” design was, from the beginning, intentional. The idea was for a simple design that only put a required amount of effort into being aesthetically pleasing, without the hassle of some over-the-top styling that took more time and effort to program than it was worth. The result of this design philosophy is a product that, whilst not looking like some “my first website” job from the late 90’s, doesn’t contain anything that would be considered too complex to be worth it.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am satisfied with how my web blog came out. The simplistic design allowed for more time for testing to make sure everything worked as intended, as well as fleshing out the content that the webpages would hold.
        <br>
        <br>
        Had I the time and ability to go back and make more changes, I would see myself straying away from the more barebones approach I took to creating the blog originally. Assuming I had the time to do so, I would opt more a slightly more complex layout to make the blog more interesting. The resulting design as it stands is, well, boring, and some time to flesh out thew page itself with some better styling wouldn’t hurt.
        </p>

<h3>2.4: Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h3>
<p>Other than the simplistic layout of my website, there is not much in terms of further improvement I could mention. The website’s design could have used more time and styling to make it more interesting to look at, and the hardware I have been working on is in serious need of an upgrade to something that can handle the stress I throw at it, But the tools and methods used for this project were more-or-less acceptable for a website of this type.
    </p>

    <h3>2.5: Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h3>
    <p>In my project, I set out to create a web blog that would contain the research and review of the web blog itself. The website had to be easy to look at, contain CCS stylings, have page navigation and, maybe, images. 
            <br>
            <br>
            whilst, admittedly, the website created does not “above and beyond”, what has been created is more than satisfactory for the purpose is was designed for. It contains all of the important elements that would be required of a modern website in order to allow it to function.</p>
