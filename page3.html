 <h3>3.1: Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
<p>In my project I made use of a few tools in order to keep my affairs in order and stay on track to completing my web blog. One of these tools was trello, which I had been using to keep track of the tasks I was undertaking and the order I was completing them. However, I found that I was able to faster keep a mental track of what I was doing, and what needed to be done. Going back and forth to the trello board over and over to repeatedly update my progress kept was a time-consuming endeavour that granted me no actual benefit.
        <br>
        <br>
        Trello is a very useful tool, and can be a very effective method of keeping track of progress when developing in large teams. however, because I was quite literally the only person working on my project; a small four-page website that only made use of a single CSS file, the process of constantly updating a schedule that was already small enough to easily memorise concluded on time being wasted on something that did not add anything of value to the project in any meaningful way. It was just another tick box to check off.
        <br>
        <br>
        Working in teams may be a very efficient method of divvying up tasks on larger projects to have several things being worked on at once. however, the web project I was creating had a very small scope. Completing it in a team would create a “too many cooks in the kitchen” scenario, where the time required to set up the tools and systems required for collaborative development could’ve been more efficiently spent just knuckling down and completing the project single-handedly. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Whilst it could have sped up the process to have other people working on smaller, less important aspects of the project, such as having one person keeping tabs on the trello board, another writing up the content for the website and so on, the simple fact of the matter is that the intended scope of the project was not large enough to warrant more than one person working on the website at a time.

    <h3>3.2: Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h3>
    <p>If anything could be taken away from my time working on my web project, it’s that you should take the time to look at your development process, and assess on what is required and what is just busywork for the sake of busywork. In my case, the trello board I was maintaining on the side of creating the actual web project itself was more time-consuming than it was worth because, with the relatively tiny scope of the project, tasks did not really warrant an entire system for tracking them. I was gaining no real benefit from maintaining the trello board and my workflow suffered for it.</p>

<h3>3.3: Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h3>
<p>In my time developing my web blog, I have learned quite a fair bit about optimising workflow. This has mostly came from rectifying my mistakes in hindsight, as most of what I learned has been learned the hard way.
        <br>
        <br>
        Firstly, it must be remembered that, whilst certain tools and tactics may be useful for improving workflow, these tools can be more situational than first observed. For example, trello and slack are tools that are most-often found at the centre of large, collaborative efforts. however, their effectiveness in organisation and communication across large projects is lost when the scope of the project itself is too small to warrant their use. Why would you need tools designed for collaboration on a one-man project? What use do they have in single-man teams?
        <br>
        <br>
        This becomes a problem when you’re so used to using these situational tools that you just use them in every project for the simple sake of familiarity. Taking the time to look at what you’re doing and deciding what you really need to be using for this project. Yes, technically speaking, it would be more effective to knock down a door with an 18-wheeler lorry. But in the time spent planning, sourcing and setting up the vehicle for use, you could’ve just acquired a sledgehammer and done it yourself with less hassle, less expenditure and less mess.
        <br>
        <br>
        In short, being sensible with choosing the tools you use for your project can save you plenty of time and hassle.

<h3>3.4: Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.
    </h3>
    <p>An important factor to testing your product is thinking about how it’s going to be used, and in what use cases will is most-commonly find itself. For example, a web blog like the one I have developed is a website, and people tend to use a multitude of combinations of devices, operating systems and web browsers to access websites. For this, I must plan my project to be flexible enough to have it blanket-support all the different common scenarios in which my web blog may be accessed.
            <br>
            <br>
            In terms of reviewing the design and content of the website is to make use of peer-reviewing. Get someone to look at it and give their thoughts. Get multiple people to criticise your website. Looking over your work by yourself is a bad practice, as your opinion os heavily biased. After all, you’ve spent a lot of time designing and creating your project. You have an attachment to it. If you try to criticise it yourself, your mind will gloss over potential problems without you even knowing it, writing it off as “not important”. Aside from that, your opinion is subjective, and quite possibly, terrible. Getting people in to look at your work opens it up to different opinions and ideas for improvement.</p>
